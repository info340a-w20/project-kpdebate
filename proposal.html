        Topic Summary
      </h3>
      <p>
        As high school friends and officers in the same student club, we wanted to put our
        efforts into the realm of debate. The National Forensics League (NFL) is an
        organization that sponsors debate events for young students with hopes of promoting
        educational argumentation. We believe debate to be important because the skills it
        trains, like research, delivery, reasoning, and logic, transfer well as important life
        skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many types of debate events, each with their own rulesets. In high school we
        were partners in Public Forum (PuFo), which emphasizes a tag-team debate style and
        thorough research to build an argumentative case. Another popular event was Spontaneous
        Argumentation (SPAR), which took a more casual approach to debate encouraging heavy
        audience participation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though we loved debate, getting our peers to join was difficult. New joiners needed to
        put in so much work before
        getting to the actual debate that most students did not want to try. Creating an app
        that streamlines the process to the
        core experience of debate creates a strong entry point for new joiners to evaluate
        their interest in debate club.

      <h3>
        Pre-Existing Issues
      </h3>
      <p>Practically all information at local tournaments are conveyed through paper: student
        case notes, judge score-sheets, room placements, and next-round assignments. This keeps
        events slow and, because this information is often misplaced, tournament delays often
        build up and cause debate tournaments to run over time.</p>
      <p>Debate is also an especially difficult activity to get into in the first place. Many
        of the NFL’s events involve a serious amount of preparation--Public Forum cases are
        often upwards of 10 pages long with over 20 sources. The reason students participate is
        to spend their time debating--the research itself is just seen as a necessary grind,and
        convincing a complete beginner to invest that time before they can even see if they
        enjoy it discourages a lot of potential club members.</p>
      <p>Not only this, once members are recruited, there is a lack of beginner-friendly
        resources to improve at their desired event. Most students rely on the expertise of
        their debate club officers to learn. In our case, those debate officers only had some
        experience themselves, which put our school’s team at a clear disadvantage compared to
        other schools in the district with more established debate programs. Many students
        would join to explore the club, and quit when there was no clear structure for
        improving.</p>
      <p>Lastly, it was difficult for students to venture out and try a new event. Since
        students relied on the officer's past experiences, eventually everyone in the club
        competed in the one same event. Resources about events online were scattered and there
        were few example videos, especially of newer events.</p>

      <p>With a variety of different pain points affecting the high school and college debate
        experience, there is more than one way our project could help the field. Included below
        are a few of the possible solutions we have discussed.
        <ol>
          <li>Tournament organization tool. A tournament organizer can go to this website and
            create a session for
            their tournament. Competitors and judges can access the session and see current
            standings for the tournament, as
            well as room assignments for the next round. Each judge can be assigned a match in
            the form of a task--upon
            completion of the match, the judge will upload their scores to the web app,
            including notes on how the debate
            went. This allows the tournament organizer to evaluate scores and keep the
            tournament moving more smoothly.
            Addresses the issue of tournaments being disorganized and slow.</li>
          <li>A website with short or simple sample cases donated by schools as a public
            resource. This allows new debate
            students to immediately try their hand at debating rather than spending hours
            developing a case first. By
            evaluating whether they enjoy the sport sooner, this encourages the students to
            become regular members of their
            debate club. This would also be a tool to help new debaters to learn how to craft
            research cases. New debaters can
            study the templates and see what role each section of the content plays in the
            debate.</li>
          <li>Debate “game” that automates the mediation of a SPAR event. The game would
            generate a random topic, manage the
            time of each speaking segment, and prompt the audience to vote on a winner at the
            end. It is a portable way to
            practice fundamental debate skills, like style, delivery, logic, reasoning, and
            thinking fast on your feet. In
            addition, it also works as an accessible debate tool because of how little
            preparation is necessary for the SPAR
            event. Topics are casual (e.g. “Which is better: cats or dogs?”), making SPAR the
            most approachable debate event for new competitors.</li>
