        Topic Summary
    </h3>
    <p>
        As high school friends and officers in the same student club, we wanted to put our efforts into the realm of debate. The National Forensics League (NFL)  is an organization that sponsors debate events for young students with hopes of promoting educational argumentation. We believe debate to be important because the skills it trains, like research, delivery, reasoning, and logic, transfer well as important life skills. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
    There are many types of debate events, each with their own rulesets. In high school we were partners in Public Forum (PuFo), which emphasizes a tag-team debate style and thorough research to build an argumentative case. Another popular event was Spontaneous Argumentation (SPAR), which took a more casual approach to debate encouraging heavy audience participation. <br>
